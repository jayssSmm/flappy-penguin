# 🐧 Flappy Penguin Project – Day 17

Built as part of my **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** course, this project simulates a flappy-style penguin using only **HTML and CSS**.

---

### 🧠 What I Practiced:
- `position: absolute` and z-index layering
- Using `transform: rotate()` to simulate motion
- Organized animation flow using class-based structure

---

### 🎮 Special Elements:
- Flappy Penguin flaps as it "flies"
- CSS-only motion + static visual design

---

### ✅ Status:
Completed on **Day 17** of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
